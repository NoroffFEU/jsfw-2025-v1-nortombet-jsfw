## 📌 About the Project

**Online-Shopping** is an e-commerce platform where users can browse and buy products in a safe test environment. Users can search for products, sort them, view detailed product information, add items to a cart, and proceed through a checkout process.

### Key Features:

- 🔍 Product Search
- 🔃 Sorting by various criteria
- 🛒 Add to Cart functionality
